            This project topic was inspired by a Singaporean documentary series called Inside Maximum Security which focuses on what prisoners’ experience during their incarceration. The documentary depicts not only the lives of inmates, but also the struggles and concerns they would encounter once they are freed from prison. 
            <br><br>
            As Singapore aim and strive to be an inclusive society that creates fair opportunities for all, we should see past the stereotypes to realize the potential of individuals who have helped welcome ex-offenders to transform themselves and our society for the better.
            <br><br>
            Our motivation is to review ex-offenders' employment rates over time based on their participation in programs such as SCORE as well as the considerations and views from the public on inmates. A correlation could also be drawn between data and variables such as yearly enrolment of inmates, ex-inmates’ academic results, completion rate of programmes by inmates, public views on inmates, etc.
