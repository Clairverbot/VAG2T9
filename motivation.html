            This project topic was inspired by a Singaporean documentary series called Inside Maximum Security which focuses on what prisonersâ€™ experience during their incarceration. The documentary depicts not only the lives of inmates, but also the struggles and concerns they would encounter once they are freed from prison. As Singapore aim and strive to be an inclusive society that creates fair opportunities for all, we should see past the stereotypes to realize the potential of individuals who have helped welcome ex-offenders to transform themselves and our society for the better. 
            <br><br>
            Our motivation is to review the efficacy of current programmes and training offered to ex-offenders to improve their employability. Most of these efforts are available to ex-offenders towards the tail-end of their incarceration period such as SCORE, Community-Based Programmes (CBP), Vocational Skills Training, and Academic Programmes. Through dissecting the data available at different levels of abstraction, the team can investigate what can be improved or done additionally so that the skillsets and knowledge of ex-offenders are more tailored to the needs of the current workforce and economy. In doing so, ex-offenders are better supported as they reenter the labour market and fundamentally, their qualities of life can be improved.
