        Singapore is quoted to be an “ability-based, aspiration-driven” society (OECD, 2011) which prioritizes performances and disproportionately allots resources to those more likely to succeed (Lee, 2017). This poses a challenge on the reintegration of ex-inmates into society, especially employment. The Yellow Ribbon Project and the SCORE programme, which oversees employment and skills training for inmates, have worked tirelessly to destigmatize the hiring of ex-offenders into organisations.
        <br><br>
        Still, employability is a hurdle with the lingering stigma of incarceration and limited employment histories. Securing employment is paramount to an ex-offender's rehabilitation and reintegration, as it serves as a starting point for them to be independent and self-sufficient. This begets the question: “How can Singapore further support ex-offenders as they re-enter into the labour market?”. Our project investigates the efficacy of our current efforts and derives meaningful insights.
